## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses Redux for global state management
- Local component state for form data and UI state
- localStorage for preference persistence

### API Integration
- RTK Query for API calls
- Mutations for profile updates
- Queries for user data fetching

### Form Handling
- Controlled components with React hooks
- Client-side validation
- Error state management
- Loading states and feedback

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Usage

### Accessing the Profile
Users can access their profile through:
1. Header user menu ‚Üí Profile
2. Direct navigation to `/profile`

### Navigation
- Use tab navigation to switch between sections
- Each section is self-contained with its own form
- Changes are saved independently per section

### Security Features
- All forms require authentication
- Password changes require current password verification
- 2FA setup includes backup code generation
- Sensitive operations require additional verification

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Profile picture cropping and editing
- Advanced notification preferences
- Language-specific content
- Profile export/import
- Social media integration

### API Integration
- Real avatar upload endpoints
- User preference synchronization
